# Cédric Corbière based on Derek Wyatt's Vim Configuration

Yup... it's a vim configuration.

To install it, do the following:

* Wipe out your `~/.vimrc` file and `~/.vim` directory (back up if you wish)
* `git clone https://github.com/Korbik/vim-config.git ~/.vim`
* `ln ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`
* I use [VundleVim](https://github.com/VundleVim/VundleVim.vim), so you'll have to install that into `~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`.  You will probably also have to run `:PluginInstall` when you start up Vim as well.
* Start Vim

Occassionally plugins will get updates, and you should use the `:PluginUpdate` command to get those updates.
